# Overview

Hi! In the spirit of coding for fun more than learning. I tried creating something personal that we can be interested 
and passionate about. Nothing to serious and yet powerful enough to teach new skills. Remember for once how in the 80s 
and 90s, originated programmers. This project is for my own amusement touching for the first time graphics and the 
creation of images using C++. Not only that but animating a 2D image and make it look 3D.

# Future Work

- Make the color generation gradient instead of one color at the time. 
- While the shape changes color, the amount of times it does is still way to fast. An improvement would be to slow the change in colors while keeping the refresh rate intact.
- Have new shapes and forms.
- Make the color, background or shape change with music. (Make it reactive)
